# Nevernote

This is a simple note-taking app with a REST API, written for the [Ruby on Rails course at Eleven Fifty](https://elevenfifty.com/course/ruby-on-rails/) by your friends at [Fretless](https://github.com/getfretless).

[Build the app from scratch yourself with our wiki](https://github.com/getfretless/nevernote/wiki/01-Init-a-Rails-4.2.4-Project)!

Although this app uses ERB, the wiki provides examples in both ERB and HAML.
